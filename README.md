# Non-Standard Regression

Notes and code related to a couple of presentations on some less-commonly-taught types of regression:

* Censored regression
* Logit-normal regression
* Beta regression
* Ordered logistic regression
* Multinomial logistic regression

An RMarkdown summary, with sample R and Stan code, is available [here](https://kaplanas.github.io/nonstandard-regression/nonstandard_regression.html).
